## Purpose
_Describe the `Purpose` of the pull request. Include background information if necessary_

A PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE helps to standardize the important information in a Pull Request. Software is hard and appications are large, so no matter how self-documenting the code is today, we need to provide a healthy environment for discussion tomorrow. 

Writing a Pull Request can feel like a hurdle that stands between the developer and shipping code. This leads to some common issues with Pull Requests:

> This Pull Request . . .

> - has no description

> - does not solve the problem

> - just wordsplains the code

> - is way over my head

## Approach
_The `Approach` section details 'HOW does this change fulfill the purpose?'_

This [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexyford/pull-request-template/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) adds structure to our PRs in order to solve some `common issues`

### Write a Description
> This Pull Request has no description

- [ ] Write `Write a Description` Section :confounded:

### Research the Problem
> This Pull Request does not solve the problem

- [ ] Write `Research the Problem` Section

### Let the Code Tell Us About the Code
> This Pull Request just wordsplains the code

- [ ] Write `Let the Code Tell Us About the Code` Section

### Share the Knowlege
> This Pull Request is way over my head

- [ ] Write `Share the Knowlege` Section


Just a reminder, writing a Pull Request, like code, is a process. It requites more than one iteration to get it right.

## Learning
_The `Learning` section explains 'WHAT I learned in boating school today is ...'_

Approach each PR as a docuement for sharing knowledge. When we teach the assignee/reviewer through a Pull Request, we build confidence that the developer has taken due dilligence during the research phase. 

The assignee is not treated as a Merge Button Gatekeeper, but a collaborator. Awell written PR invites everyone to learn and and be part of the process of shipping code.
